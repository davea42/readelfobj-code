    Minor renaming.

    --suppress-de-alloc-tree
    and ignore it (it does not apply to these).

    commit 8000b30b70173ffd777b8498ab7c8277d00447d5

    When a Macos segment has no sections we
    now simply go on to the next segment.
    And we change a garbage segment name to <no name>
    Directly related to ossfuzz446356422
    which found errors before (corrupted Mach-o object)
    Was a bug in the code for a few days.
